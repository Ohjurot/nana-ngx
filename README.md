# Nana Generation X (Fork of: Nana C++ Library) 
[![Licence](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSL-blue.svg?style=flat)](BSL-LICENSE)


**Warning: This is NOT the original nana repo. This is a fork that aims to continue supporting nana.**

**This fork is currently NOT operational. Until the v1.8 release please make sure to use the original nana repo! See our roadmap!**

Nana is a C++ standard-like GUI library designed to allow developers to easily create cross-platform GUI applications with modern C++ style.
This is a fork of the original [nana repository](https://github.com/cnjinhao/nana). The goals of this fork are:
- Actively supporting nana
- Moving nana to the "next generation" by
    - Unifying the build system to CMake
    - Managing dependencies, building and packaging with conan
    - Unit-Testing and Benchmarking
- Source, Documentation and Examples in one place
- Continuing the development of nana and new features

Currently it is regularly tested on Windows and Linux(X11). OSX and FreeBSD are currently NOT supported by this fork but may work. You can browse the source code and submit your pull request for contributing.

## Features
TODO: This section shall contain a list of nana's features. Also add a list of controls.

## Roadmap
This fork is currently not operation. This list will track the progress:
- [x] New repo layout for nana.
- [ ] Get CI, CLA, etc. working.  
- [ ] Encourage other developers (from original nana) to adopt their PR's to the new repo style and open a PR on this repo.
- [ ] Get v1.8-develope build on all target platforms using conan and the new build systems. 
- [ ] Finally release v1.8 as a LTS supported version. The idea is to bring one version that will stay compatible with old nana and will be supported a long time. It shall serve as a "always working" drop in replacement for migrating old projects towards "nana generation x".
- [x] Start discussions about features for v2.0.0.
- [ ] Begin development towards version 2.0.0 "nana generation x". 
- [ ] First ngx release.
